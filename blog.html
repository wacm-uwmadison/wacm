                                                   Applied CS with Android Workshop was a session focussing on applying concepts such as data structures, event handling, asynchronous programming and dynamic programming by building projects in Android.
                                                   Along with this, coding for Android provides a larger range of practical learning such as using build tools, setting up development environments, integrating SDKs & libraries.
                                                   Students who had never built mobile apps got a chance to kickstart a portfolio of cool projects while understanding how to apply all that they had learnt in classes.

                                       Every student of the CS department is expected to work in a Linux environment. Linux and the command line can be a little intimidating if one has never used Linux. 
                                       WACM organized a Basic Linux’ workshop open to all students of the CS department to build practical familiarity with the Linux environment, and using the university machines to create and test assignments.
                                       Experienced members of WACM volunteered to answer questions, provide assistance to those learning and keep the session as an experiential lesson rather than a lecture.

                                            WACM continued our mentorship program for the spring semester and this was the kick-off dinner. New mentees were assigned mentors, and the pods got together to discuss questions they had. We also had three guest speakers from gAlpha, a Madison-based accelerator and development-sprint program and some of their participants, speak to us about their experiences with the program.

                                       Every student of the CS department is expected to work in a Linux environment. Linux and the command line can be a little intimidating if one has never used Linux. 
                                       WACM organized a Basic Linux’ workshop open to all students of the CS department to build practical familiarity with the Linux environment, and using the university machines to create and test assignments.
                                       Experienced members of WACM volunteered to answer questions, provide assistance to those learning and keep the session as an experiential lesson rather than a lecture.

                                            In each cycle we choose a different theme or a topic for the day and use the luncheons as a way to let off some steam and go back to our schedules reenergized, fresh and inspired. These lunches give students the opportunity to regularly interact with female Professors in an informal setting. This is a "bring your own food" event and a sum of up to $7 is reimbursed upon receipt display. We generally have 25 participants in each of these sessions.

                                            Experienced members of WACM volunteered to answer questions, provide assistance to those learning and keep the session as an experiential lesson rather than a lecture.

                                               In partnership with Kohl’s, WACM provided an opportunity for attendees to learn about professional development.
                                               Participants engaged members of Kohl’s technology team in discussion about job search and interviewing, and self branding.
                                               This was also an opportunity to learn about the work that drives Kohl's large operations at scale and the internship opportunities they have there.

                                            Kohl's is America's largest department store chain by the number of stores. The technology team at Kohl’s works with the cutting edge of technology to solve problems in retail.
                                            Members of the tech team presented a talk about Innovation at Kohl's and Emerging Technologies in Retail. 
                                            Interacting with the developers was a way for students to learn about combing CS disciplines and applying them 
                                            to solve problems that impact end users.</p>

                                            Epic systems gave a tech talk to WACM members on mobile application development and the development process. Mobile applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, and healthcare is no exception. In this talk, Lucas Stromberd, a software engineer at Epic discussed many aspects of mobile app development along with some of the core challenges that face today’s mobile developers both in and outside of healthcare. He also spent time covering some of the key differences in developing mobile apps for the two most predominant mobile platforms - iOS and Android.
                                            Participants also had the chance to learn about mobile app development at Epic and some of the opportunities they have there.
