There are many other things that can be attached to a computer that allow a person to give information to the computer or get information from the computer.  We call these
other computer parts <i>peripherals</i>.  In the picture of Videolab, you can see two brightened regions.  The one on the left shows a scanner, while the one
on the right shows a pair of headphones.  In each of the brightened regions, you can also see a speaker that is partially hidden by the monitor.  All of these devices
are peripherals.  The scanner allows you to take a picture of a piece of paper and put it into the computer.  The speakers and headphones allow you to hear what
the computer is playing.<br><br>

Another common computer peripheral is a printer.  You can see a little graphic of a printer below.  A printer, like a monitor, speakers, or headphones, allows the computer
to give you information.  The computer is able to make a permanent picture of something by printing it on paper.
