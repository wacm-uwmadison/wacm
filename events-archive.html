									<h3>WACM Biweekly Social Lunches</h3>
									
								<img class="card-img-top" src="" alt="" width="50%" align="right"								
								<br><br>WACM's Biweekly lunches are a fun way to enjoy lunch and interact with peers! We'll discuss topics related to CS such as networking, scholarships, grad school applications, and learn from each other in a fun, and laidback setting.
								<br><br>We meet <b>every Thursday</b> on Zoom from 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm CT
								<br><br><b>This week, we’ll be having a special guest, Kayla Gross, the CS Dept’s Inclusion Program Manager, leading this meeting, and we would love to have everyone join us and share their experiences in CS</b>
									<br><br<b>More information:</b>Kayla Gross joined the UW-Madison Department of Computer Science as the Inclusion Program Manager in January 2021. In this role, she is responsible for increasing the enrollment and retention of women in the department. The effort is funded by a multi-year grant from the Center for Inclusive Computing. (Learn more about Kayla here: https://www.cs.wisc.edu/2021/01/26/meet-kayla-gross-cs-inclusion-program-manager/)
To begin the meeting, Kayla will provide an overview of the steps UW CS is taking to improve gender inclusivity in the department.

In the second half of the meeting, Gross will ask a series of questions to gather feedback from WACM members on actions UW CS could take to improve gender equity. Questions will cover topics including 1) what factors influenced your decision to choose CS as a major, 2) your experiences in the classroom and other department spaces, 3) and interactions with fellow students and faculty/staff.

If you are unable to make the meeting but would like to share your thoughts and feedback on gender inclusivity, you can also schedule a time to meet with Kayla directly by emailing her at kgross2@wisc.edu.
