					<h2>Undergrad Research</h2>
					<p>The summer programs listed here are research oriented. These programs are great opportunities for an undergraduate who is interested in continuing to graduate school because it will help to strengthen her application and give her an opportunity to explore research before reaching graduate school.</p>
					
					<h3>CRA-W</h3>
					<p>The CRA-W Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates (DREU) is a program for undergraduates where the undergraduate student has the opportunity to spend the summer conducting research at another university with a faculty member at that university. For more information, see <a href="http://www.cra-w.org/dreu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p>The CRA-W Collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates (CREU) is a program where a group of students can apply for funding from CRA-W to work on a project with a professor at their university during the school year. The funding can be used for a stipend for the students or for travel to conferences. For more information, see <a href="http://www.cra-w.org/creu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
